          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Asylum Seekers in the United States</h2>
          <p class="text-white"> Asylum laws are an increasingly relevant political topic: globally and nationally. 
            With recent violence and political turmoil in places like Syria and Venezuela, global asylum seekers, those fleeing persecution in their home countries,
          have been steadily increasing. The UN estimates that today there are 3.1 million asylum seekers worldwide. In the United States, asylum applications have fluctuated in the past 4 years.
          </p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <p class="text-white">
            Most notably, there was a sharp decline in total and defensive asylum applications from January 2017 to April 2017. 
            This is the same time of Trump's controversial 'Muslim Ban' and Executive Order 13767, which made it more difficult
            to claim asylum at the border.

            <br/>
            During his campaign and tenure in office, Trump has repeatedly called out asylum seekers for 'scamming' the system.
            This highlights one of the injustices that asylum seekers face when seeking refuge in the United States.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Vulnerability to Political Climate</h2>
          <p class="text-white">
            The Executive Branch's rhetoric around asylum seekers can influence policy and popular discourse.
            For people seeking asylum, their legal process
            and outcomes may change drastically under different presidents.
          </p>

          <div class="row">
            <p class = 'text-white'>
              For affirmative asylum seekers, it may be getting more difficult to navigate 
              the complex legal system. This is shown through the increased number of applicants
              who are referred to immigration court because they filed too late and those who are being
              denied asylum because they were not present at their interview. <br> <br>
              Interestingly, while ~12% more applicants are classified as "No Show Denial" from 2015 to 2019,
              there is only a ~3% increase in affirmative applicants who did not
              show to their interview for the same time period, as seen in the graph below.
              </p>

          <p class="text-white">
              The media may respond to the agenda of the Executive Branch, or may highlight topics which allows them
              to become agenda-setters for political figures. Click on a bar (above) to see an article (below) from the New York
              Times from the same month about asylum.

              Besides the vulnerability to popular discourse as established by the media and key
              political figures, asylum seekers are often left on their own to navigate
              the complicated immigration bureaucracy. This is the root to another injustice faced by
              those seeking asylum in the US.

              <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Bureaucratic Inefficiencies</h2>
              <p class="text-white">
                  Even for well versed legal experts, the asylum system is complicated. For those
                  entering the country without any information and potentially
                  no grasp on the language, it is no doubt extremely confusing. 
                  <br> <br>
                  Use the animation below to explore the known and unknown legal paths of asylum seekers in 2018.
                  Each dot represents 100 cases. Click on the stops to see where asylum seekers go from there.
                </p>
                <div id="animation"></div>
                <script src="js/vis3.js"></script>
                <p class="text-white">
                    The cases stuck on the edge represent asylum seekers for whom the outcome of their case is not known.
                    <br>The data available on asylum seekers leaves many gaps where numbers do not quite add up.
                    It is impossible to know how many of the unaccounted for cases are in detention.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As shown above, most asylum cases are referred to an immigration judge who will make a final ruling on their case.
                    This can often take years, as there are hundreds and thousands of backlogged cases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, different immigration courts and officials across the country
                    often have very distinct outcomes. This is another way in which asylum seekers
                    are not afforded the American ideal of due process.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    The most vulnerable populations are subject to an unjust and voltile system, both depriving
                    them of their rights to a fair trial and due process of the law as is stated in the 
                    United States Constitution.
